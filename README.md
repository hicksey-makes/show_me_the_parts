# Show Me The Parts
A reusable, responsive UI for retrieving and showing car parts from a database.

Prob: Client wants one page to show parts in inventory relevant to a specific car.
- The same page can be used for many differing cars' parts that are stored in the database.
- Needs to be a fully responsive design. 
- Client has static webpage version that needs to be made responsive and dynamic.

Soln:
- I'm building this page with React.js.
- I'm using Webpack to bundle modules.
- I'm using REST API calls to add/retrieve data to faiRESTdb (online NoSQL database).  

Update: the database stopped being serviced sometime in 2022, and has since returned a server error preventing data from being fetched :(.
